# Instruction of our motor controller #

There are four members in our team, whose are Lishan Zhu(hardware design), Zhoulin Zhai(software design), Long Qin(structual design) and Xing Qi(algorithm design and testbench design). All of us have at least 7 years experience of motor controller design. Here are some instruction of our motor controller.

**Features**

1. Use of the latest MOSFET technology, low noise and high efficiency energy conversion.
2. Filed Oriented Control(FOC) technology used, four-quadrant control of motor torque and speed (driving and braking torque in the forward and reverse directions) is allowed without the need for directional contactors.
3. Parameters can be flexibly adjusted to suit various situations.
4. Buzzer is used to alert various faults.
5. Improve the over-temperature, over-current, over-voltage, under-voltage and other protection features to enhance system reliability.
6. According to the different needs of customers, personalized software can be customized.
7. Controller can be compatible with permanent magnet brushless, permanent magnet synchronous, AC asynchronous motor.
8. Configuration parameters can be remote program upgrades.
